      <h3>Project: CompTIA Security+</h3>
      <p>
        For this quarter, I have chosen to focus on earning the CompTIA Security+ certification as my primary professional development project. 
        This certification is a critical step toward advancing my career in cybersecurity and will significantly enhance my qualifications during my upcoming job search.
      </p>
      <p>
        After careful research and consultation, I connected with the INFOSEC Institute to explore available training options. 
        I reviewed their course catalog and pricing details and have decided to enroll in their self-paced training program. 
        This format offers the flexibility I need to balance my current responsibilities while allowing me to learn at my own pace and thoroughly absorb the material.
      </p>
      <p>
        At present, I am in the process of securing GI Bill benefits to cover the cost of the program. Once the funding is approved and made available, 
        I will officially begin the course. In the meantime, I am actively preparing by utilizing library resources and conducting independent study 
        to familiarize myself with the Security+ content and key cybersecurity concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am committed to this certification path and will provide regular updates on my progress throughout the quarter. 
        Successfully completing this certification will not only fulfill my project goal but also position me more competitively in the cybersecurity job market.

      <h3>Module 2 Progress Report</h3>
      <p>
        CompTIA Security+ has been registered and confirmed. I will be taking the program in a self-paced format over the next two months. 
        I plan to begin by the end of this week and will keep you updated on my progress.

      <h3>Module 3 Progress Report</h3>
      <p>I have officially started studying the CompTIA Security+ material and have completed the first three lessons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lesson 1: Security Fundamentals</strong> – Covered essential concepts such as the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), basic security controls, and the importance of layered security (defense in depth).</li>
        <li><strong>Lesson 2: Threat Management and Cybersecurity</strong> – Introduced the various types of cybersecurity threats, including insider threats, malware, phishing, and social engineering. Also discussed strategies for identifying, mitigating, and responding to threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Lesson 3: Threats and Attacks on Endpoints</strong> – Focused on endpoint vulnerabilities and how devices such as laptops, mobile phones, and IoT devices can be targeted. Explored mitigation strategies like patching, endpoint protection platforms (EPP), and strong authentication methods.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

      <h3>Module 4 Progress Report</h3>
      <p>Continuing my studies, I have now completed two more lessons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lesson 4: Endpoint and Application Development Security</strong> – Emphasized secure coding practices, application hardening, patch management, mobile device security, and the role of secure application development lifecycles such as DevSecOps.</li>
        <li><strong>Lesson 5: Cryptography</strong> – Explained core cryptographic concepts including encryption, hashing, public/private key infrastructure (PKI), digital signatures, and certificate authorities. The lesson also covered real-world applications like HTTPS and secure email.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Module 5 Progress Report</h3>
      <p> On this Module 5 i will learn the following</p>
      <p>Public Key Infrastructure is a framework used to securely manage encryption keys and digital certificates. It enables secure communication over the internet by using asymmetric encryption, where a public key encrypts data and a private key decrypts it.

        Key components of PKI include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Certificate Authorities (CAs): Trusted organizations that issue and verify digital certificates.</li>
        <li>Registration Authorities (RAs): Entities that authenticate the identity of users before certificates are issued.</li>
        <li>Digital Certificates: Electronic credentials that link a public key with an entity's identity (like a domain or person).</li>
        <li>Key Pairs: The public and private keys used in asymmetric encryption.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cryptographic protocols are standardized methods that use encryption to protect data during communication. They define how algorithms and keys are used to achieve security goals like confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

        Common cryptographic protocols include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>TLS (Transport Layer Security): Secures internet traffic (e.g., HTTPS).</li>
          <li>IPSec: Secures network traffic at the IP layer, used in VPNs.</li>
          <li>SSH (Secure Shell): Encrypts remote login sessions.</li>
          <li>PGP (Pretty Good Privacy): Encrypts emails and files.</li>
          <li>S/MIME: Secures email communication using certificates.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Progress Report 6</h3>
      <p>During this phase of my CompTIA Security+ studies, I worked through Module 7: Managing data, application, and host security in mobile and specialized devices. This module contained a total of 23 activities and 12 graded assignments across four sub-lessons. Below is a summary of what I covered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>7.1 List and compare the different types of mobile devices and how they are deployed</strong> – Reviewed various mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables. Learned about deployment models like BYOD, COPE, and CYOD, including their security implications.</li>
        <li><strong>7.2 Explain the ways to secure a mobile device</strong> – Focused on security techniques including screen locks, remote wipe, encryption, containerization, and MDM (Mobile Device Management) solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>7.3 Describe the vulnerabilities and protections of embedded and specialized devices</strong> – Studied devices like SCADA, medical equipment, and vehicles. Emphasis was on vulnerabilities such as hardcoded credentials and lack of patching, with protection measures like network segmentation and firmware updates.</li>
        <li><strong>7.4 Explain the issues surrounding securing specialized devices</strong> – Examined the limitations of securing legacy systems and devices with restricted resources, and strategies like physical controls, access limitations, and compensating security measures.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

      <h3>Progress Report 7</h3>
      <p>In this stage of my studies, I completed Module 8: Identifying physical and network security threats. This module consisted of 30 activities and 9 graded assignments spread across three sub-lessons. Here's a breakdown of the lessons and key takeaways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>8.1 Describe the different types of networking-based attacks</strong> – Covered attack types such as DDoS, man-in-the-middle, DNS poisoning, ARP spoofing, and wireless attacks. I learned to identify these threats and understand how they impact networks.</li>
        <li><strong>8.2 List the different network assessment tools</strong> – Explored tools like Nmap, Wireshark, Nessus, and Netcat. Learned how these tools help identify vulnerabilities and assess the security posture of networks.</li>
        <li><strong>8.3 Explain how physical security defenses can be used</strong> – Discussed physical security controls including fencing, locks, mantraps, video surveillance, and guards. Understood how physical layers complement digital security measures.</li>

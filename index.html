      <h3>Project: CompTIA Security+</h3>
      <p>
        For this quarter, I have chosen to focus on earning the CompTIA Security+ certification as my primary professional development project. 
        This certification is a critical step toward advancing my career in cybersecurity and will significantly enhance my qualifications during my upcoming job search.
      </p>
      <p>
        After careful research and consultation, I connected with the INFOSEC Institute to explore available training options. 
        I reviewed their course catalog and pricing details and have decided to enroll in their self-paced training program. 
        This format offers the flexibility I need to balance my current responsibilities while allowing me to learn at my own pace and thoroughly absorb the material.
      </p>
      <p>
        At present, I am in the process of securing GI Bill benefits to cover the cost of the program. Once the funding is approved and made available, 
        I will officially begin the course. In the meantime, I am actively preparing by utilizing library resources and conducting independent study 
        to familiarize myself with the Security+ content and key cybersecurity concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am committed to this certification path and will provide regular updates on my progress throughout the quarter. 
        Successfully completing this certification will not only fulfill my project goal but also position me more competitively in the cybersecurity job market.
